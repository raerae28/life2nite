This is my application to better improve the night life experience both from a end user standpoint and a promotor standpoint.

So far there is a users model which allows for the users to login and see the events that are most prudent to them.

There is also a promotors models which allows for promotors to login and pay to input a set amount of events per month

There will be a scaffold for the events

Thats it so far.
